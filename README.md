An example package used for SICSS. The package provides multiple simple functions to be used for text analysis. These functions are count_words, get_top_n_words, and avg_word_length. To run the functions on text files, the functions run_count_words_from_file, run_top_words_from_file, and run_avg_words_from_file are included.

Take a look at core.py to see these functions.
